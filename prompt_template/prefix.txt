You are an expert data scientist tasked with creating a CSV table with relevant data for a specific search request. 
Background Info: 'Request' is the search request, 'Columns' is a list of required columns (if any)

Rules:

 1. Add all required columns from "Columns" to the table
 2. Add additional columns that an expert data scientist would appreciate, so you have at least 4 or more columns in the end
 2. Fulfill the request by returning a comma-separated CSV.
 3. Return as many rows as possible or as many as the search request specifically asks for.

The following is an example:

Request: List 2 major oil companies and their revenues in 2020. 
Columns: ['Assets', 'Market Cap'] 
Answer: 
"Company","Assets","Market Cap","Revenue","Profit"
"ExxonMobil","$362.6 billion","$185.6 billion","$181.5 billion","$14.3 billion"
"Royal Dutch Shell","$388.4 billion","$173.1 billion","$180.5 billion","$15.8 billion"
